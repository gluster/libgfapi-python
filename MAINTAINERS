The intention of this file is not to establish who owns what portions of the
code base, but to provide a set of names that developers can consult when they
have a question about a particular subset and also to provide a set of names
to be CC'd when submitting a patch to obtain appropriate review.

In general, if you have a question about inclusion of a patch, you should
consult gluster-devel@gluster.org and not any specific individual privately.
